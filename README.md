Countable is a JavaScript function to add **live paragraph-, word- and character-counting** to an HTML element. Countable is a *zero-dependency* library and comes in at **1KB** when minified and gzipped.

## Installation

The preferred method of installation is [**bower**](https://github.com/bower/bower).

```
bower install Countable
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest [zipball](https://github.com/RadLikeWhoa/Countable/archive/master.zip) or copy the [script](https://raw.github.com/RadLikeWhoa/Countable/master/Countable.js) directly.

## Usage

Countable is available as a Node / CommonJS module, an AMD module and as a global. All methods are accessed on the Countable object directly.

### Callbacks

The `live` and `once` methods both accept a callback. The given callback is then called whenever needed with a single parameter that carries all the relevant data. `this` is bound to the current element. Take the following code for an example.

```javascript
var area = document.getElementById('text')

Countable.once(area, function (counter) {
  console.log(this, counter)
})
```

```
=> <textarea id="text"></textarea>, { all: 0, characters: 0, paragraphs: 0, words: 0 }
```

Property   | Meaning
---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
paragraphs | The number of paragraphs. Paragraphs can be separated by either a soft or a hard (two line breaks) return. To use hard returns, set the corresponding option (`hardReturns`).
words      | The number of words. Words are split using spaces.
characters | The number of characters (without spaces). This contains all non-whitespace characters.
all        | The number of characters including whitespace. This is the total number of all characters in the element.

### Countable.live(elements, callback, options)

Bind the callback to all given elements. The callback gets called every time the element's value or text is changed.

```javascript
Countable.live(area, function (counter) {
  console.log(counter)
})
```

### Countable.die(elements)

Remove the bound callback from all given elements.

```javascript
Countable.die(area)
```

### Countable.once(elements, callback, options)

Similar to `Countable.live()`, but the callback is only executed once, there are no events bound.

```javascript
Countable.once(area, function (counter) {
  console.log(counter)
})
```

### Countable.enabled(element)

Checks the live-counting functionality is bound to the given.

```javascript
Countable.enabled(area)
```

### Options

`Countable.live()` and `Countable.once()` both accept a third argument, an options object that allows you to change how Countable treats certain aspects of your element's text.

```javascript
{
  hardReturns: false,
  stripTags: false,
  ignoreReturns: false,
  text2HTML: false
}
```

By default, paragraphs are split by a single return (a soft return). By setting `hardReturns` to true, Countable splits paragraphs after two returns.

Depending on your application and audience, you might need to strip HTML tags from the text before counting it. You can do this by setting `stripTags` to true.

In most cases, returns should be counted as part of the `all` property. Set `ignoreReturns` to false to remove them from the counter.

You can also supply a function to transform the value to HTML before counting it. Handy if you're dealing with a markdown textarea, for example.

## Browser Support

Countable supports all modern browsers. Internet Explorer is supported down to version 7. Note that some browsers don't implement the `oninput` event consistently so there might be differences in the way Countable works in different browsers.

## Upgrading from version 1

Upgrading from version 1.x.x is easy. Most likely, you've used something like the following:

```javascript
var area = document.getElementById('area')

new Countable(area, function (counter) {
  console.log(counter)
}, { stripTags: true })
```

The new syntax offers more functions as described above, but to keep the live-counting functionality, you just write this:

```javascript
var area = document.getElementById('area')

Countable.live(area, function (counter) {
  console.log(counter)
}, { stripTags: true })
```

* The callback parameter is no longer optional
* `options.once` has been replaced with `Countable.once()`
* `Countable.live()` and `Countable.once()` both accept one or more elements, rather than just a single one
* Inside the callback, `this` is now bound to the current element
